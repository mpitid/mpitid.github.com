        <h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
<p>This page includes various free software projects I have personally created or collaborated on. Some came out of school projects and assignments, some were started to scratch an itch, while others were created for the pure fun of it.</p>
<h2 id="purity">Purity</h2>
<p>Purity is a lightweight static analysis tool that determines the purity of <a href="http://www.erlang.se">erlang</a> functions. It started as part of my diploma thesis back at <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/" title="National Technical University of Athens">NTUA</a> and was subsequently enhanced and released as free software under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html" title="GNU Lesser General Public License">LGPL v2</a>. Besides detection of side-effects, execution environment dependencies and exceptions, it also features a very simple termination analysis. Code and documentation is available in the <a href="http://github.com/mpitid/purity">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>A highly experimental and still unfinished prototype of user defined guards for <a href="http://www.erlang.se">erlang</a> —utilising the analysis’ results— can be found <a href="https://github.com/bjorng/otp/tree/user-guards">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="spacenet">Spacenet</h2>
<p>Spacenet is a distributed programming game. It was originally conceived as a fun way to present a workshop on declarative languages, along with two fellow members of the <a href="http://foss.ntua.gr" title="NTUA Free &amp; Open Source Software Community">FOSS NTUA</a> community. It is written in <a href="http://www.erlang.se">erlang</a>, <a href="http://haskell.org">haskell</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">prolog</a>. I wrote the <a href="http://www.erlang.se">erlang</a> client/server code and some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">prolog</a> parts. The game has been tested successfully on a small LAN with 10 players. Code, documentation and screencast demos are available at the <a href="http://foss.ntua.gr/spacenet">spacenet website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="labelme">Labelme</h2>
<p>Labelme is a simple image annotation tool developed for a project in my <em>Human-Computer Interaction</em> course with a fellow student. Since the code was relatively complete and functional I decided to publish it — who knows someone may find it useful someday. It is inspired by a similar web-based tool from the <a href="http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/">MIT CSAIL Lab</a>, but written in <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/">Qt</a>. The code is available in <a href="http://github.com/mpitid/pylabelme">github</a>. You can see <a href="http://github.com/mpitid/pylabelme">labelme</a> in action in this <a href="files/labelme.ogv">screencast tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pytag">Pytag</h2>
<p>Pytag is command-line audio mass-tagging application written in <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> and based on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/">mutagen</a> library. I regularly use it to organise parts of my ever-growing music collection. For the moment the code is hosted in my <a href="http://foss.ntua.gr/hg/pytag">old mercurial repository</a>. A README can also be found <a href="http://foss.ntua.gr/~mikex/pytag">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="scripts">Scripts</h2>
<p>Besides the aforementioned applications, I have put together a collection of some the <a href="https://github.com/mpitid/scripts">scripts</a> I’ve written from time to time, which are too small to warrant a section of their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mpitid/scripts/blob/master/aconv">aconv</a> is a handy shell script for converting audio files from a variety of formats (anything <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a> supports) to ogg, mp3 or wav.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mpitid/scripts/blob/master/checksum">checksum</a> is a script that calculates multiple checksums on files without reading them multiple times. This is most likely faster if you want to calculate multiple different checksums of large files (for whatever reason), since I/O tends to be the bottleneck in such cases.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mpitid/scripts/blob/master/wgrep">wgrep</a> can be thought of as a combination of <code>wget</code> and <code>grep</code>. I use it to extract hyperlinks that match certain patterns from webpages. The pattern can refer to the URL itself, the text inside the anchor or the URL of an IMG element inside the anchor. For example, to download all the JPEG images in a webpage, one could use:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode bash">wgrep <span class="st">'\.jpg$'</span> http://some.website.com/ <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="kw">xargs</span> <span class="kw">wget</span> --content-disposition</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mpitid/scripts/blob/master/zget">zget</a> is another handy script which downloads a zip or rar archive and extracts it in one go, deleting the archive afterwards (perhaps surprisingly, this one of the scripts I use the most).</p>
